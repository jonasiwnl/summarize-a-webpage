Challenger, Gray & Christmas said 3,900 people were laid off in May due to AI. All of those cuts occurred in the tech sector, the outplacement firm said. It was the first time the firm broke out job cuts based on that factor, it said.With these moves, Silicon Valley may not only be leading the charge in developing AI but also offering an early glimpse into how businesses may adapt to those tools. Rather than render entire skill sets obsolete overnight, as some might fear, the more immediate impact of a new crop of AI tools appears to be forcing companies to shift resources.Dropbox CEO Drew Houston: AI has captured the world's collective imagination. He says the company's next stage of growth requires a different mix of skill sets, particularly in AI and early-stage product development. The company is looking for a new CEO to take over the role.Dropbox is currently hiring for multiple roles focused on AI Initiatives. CNN asked Dropbox to comment on how its realignment around AI is playing out. Dropbox directed CNN to its careers page, where it is hiring for several AI roles.

Wang: "I think that the kind of competition that we all should be thinking more about is that human specialists will be replaced by human specialists who can take advantage of AI tools"The AI-driven tech layoffs come amid broader cuts in the industry. Many tech companies have been readjusting to an uncertain economic environment and waning levels of demand for digital services more than three years into the pandemic. "parameters": {"max_length: 50, "min_length": 5 });Some 212,294 workers in the tech industry have been laid off in 2023 alone, according to data tracked by Layoffs.fyi. That's already surpassing the 164,709 recorded in 2022. The tech industry is one of the fastest-growing industries in the U.S.The tech industry has invested heavily in AI talent and tech. But in the shadow of those mass layoffs, the industry has also been gripped by an AI fervor. The tech industry is also gripped by a tech fervor and invested heavily into AI talent. The AI industry is investing heavily in the development of AI technology.In January, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 10,000 employees as part of broader cost-cutting measures.

And in March, in the same letter to staff Mark Zuckerberg used to announce plans toLay off another 10,.000 workers (after cutting 11,000 positions last November), Meta CEO outlined plans for investing heavily in AI.Even software engineers in Silicon Valley who once seemed uniquely in demand now appear to be at risk of losing their jobs, or losing out on salary gains to those with more AI expertise.

Lee also runs Comprehensive.io, which examines job listings and compensation data across some 3,000 tech companies. Lee: "It's time to get out of the tech industry and into the real world"The average salary for a senior software engineer specializing in artificial intelligence or machine learning is 12% higher than for those who don't specialize in that area. Lee says that data point he dubs \u201cthe AI premium. Average salary for senior software engineers as a whole has stayed flat, he said.Dropbox is an example of a company offering notably high pay for AI roles. Lee noted a base salary listing of $276,300 to $373,800 for a Principal Machine Learning Engineer role. Comprehensive.io data puts the current average salary for a senior software engineer at $171,895.Those looking to thrive in the tech industry and beyond may need to brush up on their AI skills.

"That type of exposure I think is absolutely critical for setting themselves up for success and once they graduate," he says. "I think it's absolutely critical," Wang says.It's not that everyone needs to become AI specialists, Wang added. Instead, workers should know how to use AI tools to become more efficient at whatever they're doing, he said.

"The differentiation in terms of talent comes from creative and effective ways to integrate AI into daily tasks," he added.
